/* CONDITIONAL STATEMENTS */

/*

  Conditional Statements are "control flow statements" that determine the flow or logic of a program based on certain conditions.
  JavaScript provides the IF, ELSE AND ELSE IF Conditional Statements.
  
  These conditional statements return boolean values of either true or false, known as "conditional logic".
