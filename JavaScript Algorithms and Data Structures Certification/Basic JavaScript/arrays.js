/* STORING MULTIPLE VALUES IN JAVASCRIPT USING ARRAYS */

/* 
  Arrays:
 
  Unlike variables, arrays can store and hold multiple values. 
  The values of arrays can be stored in very basic and simple layers, or can be extended into more complex layers or dimensions.
  This creates what are called "multi-dimensional arrays" that are essentially nested within one another.
  
*/

// Basic: One-Dimensional Arrays
let shoppingList = ["Apples", "Egg", "Bananas", "Pure Water", "Oranges"];

// Complex: Multi-Dimensions (Nested) Arrays
let myShoppingList = [
  ["Apples", 6],
  ["Egg", 1],
  ["Bananas", 2],
  ["Pure Water", 4],
  ["Oranges", 3]
];
