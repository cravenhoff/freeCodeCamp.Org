/* WORKING WITH STRINGS */

// FINDING THE LENGTH OF A STRING
let name = "Samuel";
let nameLength = name.length;

// FINDING CHARACTERS OF A STRING USING BRACKET NOTATION
let favFruit = "Apple";
let firstChar = favFruit[0]; // JavaScript, among many other languages, uses what's called Zero-based Indexing
                            // This technique starts counting indexes at 0 and not 1, like what humans would do.

// FINDING THE LAST CHARACTER OF A STRING USING BRACKET NOTATION
let color = "Purple";
let lastChar = color[color.length - 1]; // Gets the length of the color variable, subtracts it by one
                                        // and inputs the result as an "index" of the color variable.

// FINDING THE NTH CHARACTER OF A STRING
let car = "Tesla";
let char3 = car[2]; // First index begins at 0, so the third character would have an index of 2.

// FINDING THE NTH-TO-LAST CHARACTER OF A STRING
let planet = "Earth";
let char = planet[planet.length - 2]; // Gets the second-to-last character of the string "Earth".
