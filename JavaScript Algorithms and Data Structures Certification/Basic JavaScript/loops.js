/* LOOPS IN JAVASCRIPT */

/*

  => While Loops
  While loops run or execute only "while" the condition is TRUE. The loop is skipped (not executed) when the condition is FALSE.
  While loops, and loops in general, are essentially IF Statements (Conditional Statements), but instead of using multiple lines of conditional statements, loops help clean-up code and achieve the same thing with just one comman/construct with a few lines of code.

// Create a while loop to print out the numbers 1 through to 5.
let counter = 1;

while (counter <= 5) {
  console.log(counter);
  counter++;
}
