/* COMPARISON OPERATORS */

/*

  Comparison operators, are a set of operators that take a value set (two operands) and compare the value on the left with the one on the left.
  Comparison operators return boolean values of either true or false, based on the conditions being compared.
  
  Comparison operators produce what is called "conditional logic" when used in combination with conditional statements, which is their usual application.

/* 

  Equality, Strict Equality, Inequality and Strict Inequality:
  
  => Equality Operator
  Checks if one value is equal to another value.
  The equality operator in JavaScript is two equal signs/symbols: ==
  Eg: 5 == 5 (Returns TRUE) and 2 == 1 (Returns FALSE).
  
  => Strict Equality Operator
  Checks to see if one value is equal to another AND has the same data type.
  The strict equality operator in JavaScript uses three equal signs/symbols: ===
  Eg: 9 === 9 (Returns TRUE as 9 is equal to 9, and both values are number types) and 9 === "9" (Returns FALSE as 9 is equal to "9", but both have different data types).
  
  => Inequality Operator
  Checks to see if one value is not equal to another.
  The inequality operator in JavaScript uses the exclamation mark and the equal symbol: !=
  Eg: 3 != 4 (Returns TRUE) and 3 != 3 (Returns FALSE because 3 is equal to 3).
  
  => Strict Inequality Operator
  Similar to the Strict Equality Operator, except that it checks to see if one value is NOT EQUAL to another AND has a different data type.
  The strict inequality operator uses the same symbol as the inequality operator, but has an additional equal sign added to it: !==
  Eg: 7 !== "7" (Returns TRUE) and 7 !== 7 (Returns FALSE as 7 is equal to 7 and both share the same data type).
