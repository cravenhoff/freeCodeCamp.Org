/*
  FREECODECAMP EXERCISE:
  1. Use recursions to create a function that returns an array of numbers from the given starting number and ends at the specified ending integer.
  
  INSTRUCTIONS:
  => The function should return an array of integers which begins with a number represented by the startNum parameter and ends with a number represented by the endNum parameter.
  
  => The starting number will always be less than or equal to the ending number.
  
  => Your function must use recursion by calling itself and not use loops of any kind.
  
  => It should also work for cases where both startNum and endNum are the same.
